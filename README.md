**SELECTED PROJECTS** 

**Automotive Object Detection**  \[[Online Demo](https://ssd-demo-app-884945419812.us-central1.run.app/)\] \[[GitHub](https://github.com/ElliotBlackstone/automotive-ssd-object-detection)\]                                         	  	                               **Fall 2025** 

* Built a from scratch Single Shot Detector (SSD) object-detection model in PyTorch for dashcam imagery (cars, bikes, pedestrians, traffic lights), including a custom preprocessing pipeline, PyTorch Dataset/DataLoader, IoU-based cropping and augmentations, hard negative mining, and mAP@0.50 evaluation to tune architecture and training.  
* Trained the model on a 29k-image automotive dataset with 195k annotated bounding boxes, reaching 0.53 mAP@0.50 on the test set after improving data augmentations and adding oversampling (\~15% gain over the initial baseline).  
* Containerized the model with Docker and served it via a FastAPI app on Google Cloud Run as an image upload web demo.
