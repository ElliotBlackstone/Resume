**SELECTED PROJECTS** 

**Predicting Calorie Expenditure \-** *The Erdős Institute*  \[[LINK](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/summer-2025/data-science-boot-camp/elliot-blackstone/008dc3e4-1c7b-49e6-848b-bab3d772ed54)\] \[[github](https://github.com/ElliotBlackstone/S25_Predict_Calories)\]                                          	  	**Summer 2025** 

* The objective of this project is to predict the calories burned during a workout. This was part of the Kaggle competition “[Predict Calorie Expenditure](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e5/overview)”. After exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-fold validation, an AutoGluon model was the top performer, which tied for **4th place out of 4,318 teams**. Lastly, SHAP values were used to assess feature importance and to improve explainability.


**Forecasting Inventory Demand \-** *The Erdős Institute*  \[[LINK](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/spring-2025/data-science-boot-camp/elliot-blackstone/eaeaf444-44be-444f-a1aa-6d15d4e347ba)\] \[[github](https://github.com/ElliotBlackstone/EWinter25_Product_Inventory)\]                                                         **Spring 2025** 

* My team’s goal was to predict weekly demand for hundreds of different perishable baked goods purchased by \~800,000 different clients of Grupo Bimbo, a large food supplier in Mexico. The dataset (containing 75 million rows and 20 columns) was provided by a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand/overview) hosted by Grupo Bimbo. After preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, our LightGBM model helped to right-size inventory demand.
