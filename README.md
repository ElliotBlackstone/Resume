**SUMMARY** 

Mathematics PhD from the University of Central Florida with six years of postdoctoral experience. Data science and machine learning techniques have been honed by participation in the Erdős Institute data science boot camp and various Kaggle competitions. I am an award-winning educator and researcher with strong communication skills and a proven record of solving difficult problems in applied mathematics. Seeking a position as a Data Scientist or Machine Learning Engineer.

**SELECTED PROJECTS** 

**Predicting Calorie Expenditure \-** *The Erdős Institute*  \[[LINK](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/summer-2025/data-science-boot-camp/elliot-blackstone/008dc3e4-1c7b-49e6-848b-bab3d772ed54)\] \[[github](https://github.com/ElliotBlackstone/S25_Predict_Calories)\]                                          	  	**Summer 2025** 

* The objective of this project is to predict the calories burned during a workout. This was part of the Kaggle competition “[Predict Calorie Expenditure](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e5/overview)”. After exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-fold validation, an AutoGluon model was the top performer, which tied for **4th place out of 4,318 teams**. Lastly, SHAP values were used to assess feature importance and to improve explainability.


**Forecasting Inventory Demand \-** *The Erdős Institute*  \[[LINK](https://www.erdosinstitute.org/certificates/spring-2025/data-science-boot-camp/elliot-blackstone/eaeaf444-44be-444f-a1aa-6d15d4e347ba)\] \[[github](https://github.com/ElliotBlackstone/EWinter25_Product_Inventory)\]                                                         **Spring 2025** 

* My team’s goal was to predict weekly demand for hundreds of different perishable baked goods purchased by \~800,000 different clients of Grupo Bimbo, a large food supplier in Mexico. The dataset (containing 75 million rows and 20 columns) was provided by a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/grupo-bimbo-inventory-demand/overview) hosted by Grupo Bimbo. After preprocessing, feature engineering, and hyperparameter tuning, our LightGBM model helped to right-size inventory demand.
